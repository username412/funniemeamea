<p> the bongo scout is a creature found in the land of teufort, it started out as a predator to the spy crab, nearly making it extinct. </p>
<p> soldier tf2 killed aton of bongo scouts to save the spycrabs, however, the spycrab still had other damaging predators that were to sweaty and good at the game to be taken out</p>
<p> and the bongo scout nearly became extinct as well, now give me your money so that 0.0001947% of your 1 dollar donation goes to the bongo scouts. the rest will go to me</p>
<p> thank you for your time </p>
